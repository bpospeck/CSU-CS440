    "So, now you know enough python to try to implement A\\*, at least a non-recursive form.  Start with your graph search algorithm from Assignment 1.  Modify it so that the next node selected is based on its `f` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given problem, define `startState`, `actionsF`, `takeActionF`, `goalTestF`, and a heuristic function `hF`.  'actionsF' must return valid actions paired with the single step cost, and `takeActionF` must return the pair containing the new state and the path cost so far from the start state to the new state.  We can use the `Node` class to hold instances of nodes.  However, since this is not a recursive algorithm, `Node` must be extended to include the node's parent node, to be able to generate the solution path once the search finds the goal.\n",

    "  * Initialize `expanded` to be an empty dictionary\n",
    "  * Initialize `unExpanded` to be a list containing the startState node.  Its `h` value is calculated using `hF`, its `g` value is 0, and its `f` value is `g+h`.\n",
    "  * If `startState` is the `goalState`, return the list containing just `startState` and its `f` value to show the cost of the solution path.\n",
    "  * Repeat the following steps while `unExpanded` is not empty:\n",
    "    * Pop from the front of `unExpanded` to get the best (lowest f value) node to expand.\n",
    "    * Generate the `children` of this `node`.\n",
    "    * Update the `g` value of each child by adding the action's single step cost to this node's `g` value.\n",
    "    * Calculate `hF` of each child.\n",
    "    * Set `f = g + h` of each child.\n",
    "    * Add the node to the `expanded` dictionary, indexed by its state.\n",
    "    * Remove from `children` any nodes that are already either in `expanded` or `unExpanded`, unless the node in `children` has a lower f value.\n",
    "    * If `goalState` is in `children`:\n",
    "      * Build the solution path as a list starting with `goalState`.  \n",
    "      * Use the parent stored with each node in the `expanded` dictionary to construct the path.\n",
    "      * Reverse the solution path list and return it.\n",
    "    * Insert the modified `children` list into the `unExpanded`   list and ** sort by `f` values.**"
