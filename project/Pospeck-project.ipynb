For pacman, the only currently implemented AI is their most basic version of a reflexive agent. He simply evaluates actions based on the game score those actions will lead him to, nothing else. This often leads to many of the same scores for different actions which in turns ends up leading to largely random movement: particularly when there are no food pellets on any immediately adjacent spaces to pacman.\n",

    "Keep in mind, most of my tests are run with random AI for the ghosts. My first change was to avoid running into walls. Because of that, I return a large -1000 penalty for any actions that move pacman into a wall. This helped to remove a couple of useless actions in the case pacman didn't know which way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next my goal was to try and avoid losing the game: Avoiding ghosts. This is the `ghostScore`. Initially I just did a simple distance check of x+y locations. I compared the different sums from pacman's location relative to each ghost and subtracted that distance from the evaluation function's return. This wasn't all that useful as it did not consider walls and would constantly have pacman scared of hitting ghosts, freezing him in place more often than not.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided it was then time to add a check for walls so that pacman would only take avoidance actions if he was directly in line with a ghost. I played around with the direct distance between pacman and a ghost. Initially I tried values as large as 5 and 6. This still made pacman a little too timid and kept him from doing much. I ultimately kept reducing the value until it was a direct distance of 2 spaces apart for pacman to react. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this, it seemed logical to go for large point values. Outside of winning, the next best score increase was from eating ghosts. It felt appropriate to now make pacman attack ghosts if he had eaten a capsule to make the ghosts edible. It affects the `ghostScore` equally, yet opposite of when ghosts aren't scared. Because of the limited time of the capsule's effect, I again kept the limit down to 2 short spaces away. Chasing from too far away led to pacman's demise more often than not. By the time he could get to a ghost, the affect would've worn off and he'd be in far greater danger of losing himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation function now returns a summation of the game's score plus the `ghostScore`. At this point, the results still were not ideal. Pacman wouldn't win games still. He'd spend a lot of time unsure of where to go, so I thought it best to implement a somewhat greedy food search. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the next action would lead to pacman picking up a food pellet, I would add on a `foodScore` of 1000. Otherwise that score for food would be a 0. This definitely led to an improvement, but only once he found food. With empty space around him, he would still be confused on what to do. Because of this, I then added an additional check to look at each space around. If any of those directly adjacent spaces had food, I made the `foodScore` equal to 500 to push pacman in that direction. This made for decent AI when food was nearby, but what about food that isn't nearby? Pacman would still get stuck if he ran out of food immediately around him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, I added in a `nearFood` value that would be subtracted from the other values. It would check the position of all food on the board and find the \"nearest\" one to pacman. Nearest being the difference between pacman's x+y position and a food's x+y position. This created 2 benefits for pacman. Since food right next to pacman meant a smaller subtraction from the evaluation function, it would further incentivize him to move there. Second, if pacman was in an empty space, the `nearFood` value incentivized him to move towards the next closest food pellet. The closer he got, the less it subtracted from the total. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above there is a capsule tracking piece similar to the far food tracking piece. I ended up leaving it out of the evaluation function return because it never seemed to add any benefit to pacman. At best it did nothing, at worst it hindered pacman's performance."

    "It would appear walls still give this reflex agent a difficult time. The openClassic layout is the only layout without walls, and it's the only one the agent performed with some amount of success. This could be for several reasons. The only part of my reflex agent that considers walls is when dealing with ghosts. When attempting to move towards the nearest food, there's a chance that moving up will bring pacman closer to the next piece of food. That food pellet could be on the other side of a wall and pacman wouldn't be able to figure out that he needs to move around the wall to get it. This behavior would essentially leave him stranded by a wall going back and forth aimlessly. Further, since pacman is only concerned with ghosts directly in his line of sight, he cannot avoid ghosts coming around corners of walls. These limitations mean this agent is ideal when walls are not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd like to see how the number of ghosts in open space affect this agent's performance. I will run 2 more sets of openClassic with 2 and 3 ghosts, to see how the performance compares with the roughly 38% average success rate of just one ghost."

    "While still having some success, the rate definitely trends downward with more ghosts on the board as does the average score. This points to another limitation of this reflex agent. It only ever worries about the nearest ghost to pacman. In some cases, this behavior could end up having pacman run away from one ghost and towards another, effectively trapping himself. It would be beneficial to have behavior that considers multiple ghosts when running away in order to run away the \"best\" way he can. In this case, \"means\" that given 2 directions pacman would take the path leading away from other ghosts instead of towards them. \n",

    "One thing going forward to consider would be the capsules that make ghosts edible. Currently my reflex agent does not pay attention to those, it's primarily focused on eating food pellets and avoiding ghosts. I've watched enough runs of it to know that it actually avoids the capsules unless it's on the way to another food pellet. Since my initial capsule tracking didn't work effectively I have a couple of possible ideas. Maybe it would work best to tell pacman to move towards a capsule whenever he's in danger of being attacked by a ghost. Maybe it's worth going for if it's closer than any food, even if only to give pacman a chance to stall while finding more food. That would make capsule seeking a more selective task, prioritizing it over food only when necessary.\n",

    "Further, as mentioned above, better wall awareness would need to be implemented. Knowing where everything is in relation to walls and open paths would improve pacman's AI significantly. Coding all of this into a reflex agent could be difficult and time consuming however.\n",
    "\n",
    "My original plan was to start small on this project. I wanted to implement a better reflex agent, like I have, and then go further. There are many options. I could implement minimax, negamax, alpha beta pruning, A\\* search, reinforcement learning, etc.. My intent was to at least implement 2 of those other algorithms with pacman. More advanced and efficient algorithms like the ones just mentioned would let the algorithm do most of the work. A simple reflex agent is only really as good as the decision tree like structure that it gets implemented with. That route takes much more rule-based coding in a sense to achieve well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, different algorithms and reflex agents would perform differently based on various factors. For example, minimax assumes an optimal opponent. The ghost AI won't necessarily be optimal, which means minimax would likely do worse if the ghosts were moving randomly as opposed to rushing pacman. When I have some time, I fully intend to explore some of these avenues further with pacman. Maybe I'll even try to create better ghost AI too. "
