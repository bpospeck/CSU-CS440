code from: http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp11/projects/multiagent/multiagentProject.html

-The 2 main files to work with are "ghostAgents.py" and "multiAgents.py". Those are where algorithms for ghosts and pacman go.
-"pacman.py" is the main file that runs the game. Has 'GameState' type which may need to be used often according to URL.
-"game.py" has teh game logic. Describes 'AgentState', 'Agent', 'Direction', and 'Grid' which are supporting types.
-"util.py" supposedly has useful data structures for implementing some search algorithms.

-Line 485 in "pacman.py" has a description of all possible command line arguments and what they do. Tons of useful options available.
-I have the freedom to create my own layouts following the format of '.lay' files in the layouts folder.
-"commands.txt" also provides examples of terminal inputs to run different things.

Most everything else is just supporting files that I can probably ignore for the most part.
